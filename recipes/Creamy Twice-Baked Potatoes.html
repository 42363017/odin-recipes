            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 baking potatoes</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
                <li>Â¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, cubed</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons sour cream</li>
                <li>1 pinch paprika, or to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Scrub and dry potatoes, then prick several times with a fork and place on a baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from oven and cool slightly.</li>
                <li>Reduce oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Cut a thin slice off the top of each potato; scoop out pulp and place in a small bowl. Beat potato flesh, butter, milk, and salt with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth and fluffy. Fold cream cheese and sour cream into potatoes; spoon mixture into potato shells. Sprinkle with paprika and place on a baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and tops are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
